# This integration allows Dependabot to automatically update
# the development container features configured in devcontainer.json
# files within repositories on GitHub.

# Once configured, Dependabot will begin to create pull requests to update your Dev Container Features

# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for more information:
# https://docs.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates
